# B.O.U.N.C.

Author: Siddharth Sahay (ssahay2)

Design: B.O.U.N.C. ("bounce") is a mildly frustrating platformer with a bounce-based mobility mechanic - you can move and jump like in any other platformer, but to reach more difficult places you do a Bionically Orthographic Unladen Nitrous Capering (B.O.U.N.C.) jump - bounce a projectile off the ground and use it to launch yourself higher into the air. The projectile gives the player a vertical boost regardless of angle of collision (deliberately). The objective is to cross the rooftops with the fewest number of deaths. Also, the slightly tilted angle of the buildings is deliberate.

How To Play: Use A and D keys to move left and right and control jump direction, and W and S for some vertical control. Use Space to jump. You can only jump once (no double-jumping). Use left-click to shoot a B.O.U.N.C. projectile. If the projectile bounces off the map and collides with the player, the player gets a (single) vertical boost. The objective is to reach the rightmost rooftop with the fewest number of deaths.

Tips: you can cross the first gap with a regular jump, but for the next one, you'll need to do a B.O.U.N.C. jump by shooting the projectile into the gap and colliding with it as you jump the game. Good luck for the third jump. Your death count is shown on the top left. The game ends when you get to the last rooftop and touch the right edge - it then shows your number of deaths in binary.
