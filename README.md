# B.O.U.N.C.

Author: Siddharth Sahay (ssahay2)

Design: B.O.U.N.C. is a platformer with a bounce-based mobility mechanic - you can move and jump like in any other platformer, but to reach more difficult places you bounce a projectile off the ground and use it to launch yourself higher into the air.

Marketing Blurb: After many years of fruitless campaign on the planet Hywe, the Modhz find an ancient Thoromantic locomotion device, the Bionically Orthographic Unladen Nitrous Cantaloupe (B.O.U.N.C.), that could be the key to victory against the evil Beez. As a group of Modhz, fight your way to the Six Sided Stronghold and confront the Beez' greatest champion.
